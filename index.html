      <p id="R">These are pictures of Rick Grimes inside the comic book and inside The Walking Dead t.v. show. Even thought the two characters don't look the same the actor and the comic book figure's personalities are close to identical. A man who is a great leader, but seemingly doesn't want the title.A man who is willing to do anything to same his family and friends, but tries to keep a piece of his humanity. Someone who wants to rebuild society with fairness, safety, trust, and without fear.</p>

      Andrea now is the recent comics the lover of Rick, the step mother of to Rick's son Carl, and an overall exceptional sniper. In the show the only things that are consistant in the show is that she is blond, had a younger sister, had a close relationship with Dale (not romantic like in the comic book), and she was a great shot. In the show she did not have a romantic relationship with Rick and she dies in the early seasons of the show.

      Carl is the son of Rick and Lori. Carl's mother and sister both died in the comic book when the governor attack the prison that they were staying at. But in the tv show only Lori died and Carl's sister is still alive. Carl has been shot in the chest and the eye in both the comic book and the tv show. Carl throughout both of the series has been trying to prove to himself and his father that he isn't scared and he can protect those around him. He doesn't fully share his father's ideals of the new world that they're tring to shape.

      Michonne is one of the best character in the show, but at the beginning of the comics not so much. In the comic and in the show Michonne the two character almost seem like they are two very differnet people and her backstory was altered a bit inside of the comic book. In the comic Michonne was on her own for a lot of the time. She walked around with her dead boyfriend and her boyfriend's best friend. They were zombies and she kept them around for protection and possiby as a memory of the past. The sword and the zombies are really the only things that are the same. In the prison she begins a sexual relationship with Tyrone who at the time was with Carol, this is only the beginning. In the comics Michonne is depicted as the promiscous character who refuses to connect with anyone. In the show Michonne finds Andrea and together they care for each other till Andrea goes off with the governor and Michonne goes to the prison. Michonne is the voice of reason and really Rick's right hand no pun intended. Also Rickk and Michonne engage in a romantic relationship later in the show.

      The governor was completely insane, you would know this if you read the comics, the book 'Road to Woodbury', or even seem the show. He keeps a zombie girl who many people think is his daughter, but really is his neice. Takes his brother's identity, and keeps a tank full of zombie heads. When learning that Rick's group were safe within the prison he set out to take over. This didn't end well for either the governor or Rick, since the governor got tortured by Michonne, killed, and had his niece 'killed'. For Rick he lost the prison, and in the comic his 'daughter'(possibility that she was really his bestfriend Shane's baby), and his wife.
